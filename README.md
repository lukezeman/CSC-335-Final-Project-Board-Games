My idea:

- The "view" folder in src is the overall view in which we will run the program and have the initial page that has buttons which will then call the other games' views.
- We will have to have at least a new game button, maybe in a menu like the reversi project, for each game's GUI not in the overall view.
- We will need a back button to get back to the overall view in which the user can select which game, possibly saving the game that's in progress that we just exited.
- We will need a save/load for each game, like we did for reversi, I have the board classes already.
